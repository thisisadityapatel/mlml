Project Title: Predicting House Prices using Regression Algorithms

Project Overview: Machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on various factors such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and other relevant features. Explored both uni-variable and multi-variable linear regression models, as well as polynomial regression algorithms, trained using scikit libraries.

Objectives:
To explore different regression algorithms and identify the most accurate model for predicting house prices
To identify the most important factors affecting house prices and how they contribute to the prediction accuracy of the model
To develop a application that allows users to input features of a house and receive a predicted price based on the model developed in this project.
